## About

Ultra-simple apps for reference use. They show how a React-Redux app is divided into parts and how those parts work together and are labelled--the Monolithic TodoList example within src will show everything at a glance whereas the Counter example also shows a standard file structure.

## Purpose

So I don't lose sight of the React-Redux paradigm when building a growing app and to reduce "how do you do this again?" time.
